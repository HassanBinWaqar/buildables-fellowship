🧠 Pro Tips & Best Practices

Use minmax() in CSS Grid for fluid layouts

Prefer flex: 1 with gap instead of hard-coded widths

Always provide fallback colors for backdrop-filter

Pair transition only with specific properties

Keep modular styles for reusable UI components

🌟 Core Learning Principles

"Code is more about clarity than cleverness."

Clarity First → Write clean, readable, maintainable code

Build in Public → Document your journey openly

Production Mindset → Focus on scalable, reusable components

Consistency Matters → Organized repo, consistent commits, and professional docs
