      //why use DOM?
      // The DOM (Document Object Model) allows us to interact with and manipulate the structure, style, and content of web pages dynamically.
      // It provides a way to access and modify HTML elements, attributes, and styles using JavaScript.

      //what is DOM? AND BOM???
      // The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects.
      // The BOM (Browser Object Model) refers to the objects provided by the browser that allow interaction with the browser itself, such as the window and navigator objects.

      //what is the difference between DOM and BOM?
      // The main difference is that the DOM is focused on the document structure and content, while the BOM is focused on the browser environment and its features.
      //what is the difference between DOM and BOM?
      // The DOM is used to manipulate the content and structure of a web page, while the BOM provides access to browser-specific features and functions.
      // The DOM is part of the HTML document, while the BOM is part of the browser environment.

      //what is $0?
      // $0 is a special variable in the browser's developer console that refers to the currently selected element in the Elements panel. It allows you to quickly access and manipulate that element using JavaScript.
      // It is a convenient way to interact with the selected element without having to search for it in the DOM tree manually.

# Understanding DOM and BOM in JavaScript

## 1. **DOM (Document Object Model)**

Think of a **website** as a **tree**:

* The **HTML file** is like the trunk.
* Each element (heading, paragraph, button, image, etc.) is like a branch or leaf.

When your browser loads a webpage, it **creates a model (a structure)** of the page called the **DOM**.

### Key points:

* **DOM = HTML in a tree form**
* JavaScript can **access and change anything** in this tree.
* Example:

  * Add new text
  * Change colors
  * Hide or show elements

### Example:

HTML:

```html
<h1 id="title">Hello World</h1>
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
document.getElementById("title").innerText = "Welcome!";
```

Result:

* The heading on the webpage changes from **Hello World** to **Welcome!**
* You did this using the **DOM**.

So **DOM = How JavaScript interacts with your webpage**.

---

## 2. **BOM (Browser Object Model)**

If the DOM is about **the webpage**, the **BOM is about the browser** itself.

It lets you control:

* The **window** (size, open, close, scroll)
* The **URL** (location)
* The **history** (forward/backward)
* The **navigator** (browser info)

### Example:

```javascript
// Show an alert
window.alert("Hello from BOM!");

// Get browser width
console.log(window.innerWidth);

// Go to another page
window.location.href = "https://google.com";
```

---

## **Difference between DOM and BOM**

* **DOM** → Think **Page**
  (All the HTML elements)
* **BOM** → Think **Browser**
  (Everything the browser gives you besides the page)

---

### Quick Analogy:

* **DOM:** "Inside the house" – You can rearrange the furniture (HTML elements).
* **BOM:** "The house itself" – You can open/close windows, check the address, etc.

Would you like me to:

1. Make a **simple diagram** (DOM vs BOM) for you?
2. Or give you **fun practice tasks** to learn them interactively?
3. Or both?
