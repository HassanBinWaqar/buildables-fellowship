## ðŸŒ± Day 3 â€” Highlights
**CSS Transitions, Transforms & Animations**  
Today I focused on making UIs **interactive and dynamic with pure CSS**:

- **Transitions:** Smoothly animate property changes like hover effects and button states.  
- **Transforms:** 2D (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, `skew`) and 3D (`rotateX`, `rotateY`, `perspective`).  
- **Animations:** Keyframed movements using `@keyframes` for spinners, bouncing effects, etc.  
- **Hover Effects & Micro-interactions:** Small, meaningful motions to improve UX.  

**Project:** Interactive CSS Mini UI â€” [Live Demo / Code](./day3-css/project/)

**Pro Tips Learned:**  
- Always pair `transition` with specific properties.  
- Use `ease-in-out` or `cubic-bezier()` for realistic motion.  
- Subtle animations are better than overwhelming ones.  
- 3D perspective adds depth and immersive feel.

## ðŸŒ± Core Learning Principles
- **Clarity over Cleverness:** Write clean, readable, maintainable code.  
- **Learn in Public:** Documenting my journey openly.  
- **Build with Purpose:** Code with intent, focusing on UX & developer experience.  
- **Consistency & Best Practices:** Organize projects, notes, and exercises professionally.
