# Day 1: Foundations with HTML5

## Reflection
Today was about returning to the fundamentals. Instead of just reviewing tags, I focused on the principles that make HTML powerful: **meaningful structure** and **inclusive design**. I now see HTML not as a mere skeleton but as the accessible, semantic bedrock of the web.

## Learning Objectives
The goal for today was to move beyond syntax and understand the *why* behind the code.
*   **Semantic HTML:** To use elements that describe the purpose of the content, not just its appearance.
*   **Web Accessibility (a11y):** To build forms and structure pages that are usable by everyone, including people using assistive technologies.
*   **Validation & Standards:** To write standards-compliant code that ensures consistency across browsers.

## Key Takeaways
1.  **HTML is an accessibility API.** The tags we choose provide critical context to screen readers.
2.  **A well-structured form is a user-friendly form.** Proper labeling and grouping reduce frustration and errors.
3.  **`<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`** are not interchangeable. Each has a specific purpose that helps define the document's outline.

## Project: Art Connect
The project for today was to build a simple art connect page . I challenged myself to implement every best practice I learned:
*   **Full Semantic Structure:** Using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
*   **Accessible Form:** A "Contact Me" form with properly linked `<label>` elements and logical grouping.
*   **Meaningful Comments:** The code includes comments to explain my structural choices.
