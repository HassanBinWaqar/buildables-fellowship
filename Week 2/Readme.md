Got it, Hassan 🙂

The reason your section **doesn’t look proper** on GitHub is due to **Markdown formatting issues**.
Specifically:

1. There’s **no blank line** between some headings and content.
2. Some bullet points are missing proper spacing.
3. Windows CRLF line endings might be breaking the Markdown rendering.

Also, since you want me to **remove the GitHub Pages deployment part**, I’ll clean up the formatting and rewrite the entire section so it looks **professional on GitHub**.

Here’s the **fixed and optimized Markdown**:
