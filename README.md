# Buildables Fellowship - MERN Track

Hello! This repository is my personal learning log and project portfolio for the Buildables MERN Stack Fellowship. My goal is to not only complete the assigned tasks but to deeply understand the core concepts, document my journey, and build a foundation of best practices in web development.

Each day of the fellowship is dedicated to a specific topic. This folder contains:

*   **Build with Purpose:** Every line of code is written with intent, considering the end-user and developer experience.
